# 🛠️ Integration and Comparison of vision models for smart inspection cell


This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a **deep learning–based computer vision system** for automated surface defect inspection of automotive spur gears. The project focuses on detecting and classifying common manufacturing defects using **YOLOv8** and **MobileNetV2**, with an emphasis on **accuracy, robustness, and inference latency**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Surface defects such as **scratches, dents, cracks, and pitting** can significantly affect the reliability of automotive spur gears. Traditional inspection methods are often subjective and difficult to scale. This project explores a **data-driven vision-based approach** using deep learning models to automate defect inspection and evaluate their feasibility for industrial deployment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Train **YOLOv8** for defect detection and localization  
- Train **MobileNetV2** for lightweight image-level defect classification  
- Compare both models using industrial performance metrics  
- Measure inference latency and runtime behavior  
- Assess feasibility for real-world inspection scenarios

## 📂 Dataset Generation Pipeline

The dataset used in this project is **synthetically generated** to overcome the lack of publicly available spur gear defect datasets.

**Workflow:**
1. Spur Gear CAD Modeling (CATIA – defect-free geometry)  
2. Defect Modeling (Onshape – scratch, dent, crack, pitting)  
3. Synthetic Image Generation (multiple views, lighting, orientations)  
4. Manual Annotation (LabelImg – YOLO `.txt` format)  
5. Dataset Split (Train / Validation / Test)
